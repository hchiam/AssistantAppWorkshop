Use Actions on Google, Dialogflow, and Firebase to create a todo application with a conversational UI.

# Missed part of the workshop?

To catch up, complete [Step 0](./00-setup.md), then update your application to reach one of the [checkpoints](./checkpoints.md).

# Steps

In Step 0, you'll set up a new Actions on Google application, backed by Dialogflow and Firebase.

In Steps 1 through 4, you'll add four pieces of functionality to your application: creating new todos, listing existing ones, and updating a todo's status and text.

After each step, you'll get to test your application's new functionality through the Actions on Google simulator.

## [Step 0: Setup](./00-setup.md)

- Create an Actions on Google project
- Connect the Actions on Google project to Dialogflow
- Integrate the Dialogflow project with Firebase through the Inline Editor
- Setup Firebase Database
- Enable Dialogflow's Small Talk feature

## [Step 1: Create Item](./01-create-item.md)

- Create an intent that creates a new todo
- Change the project's Firebase Function to add the todo to Firebase Database

## [Step 2: Show List](./02-show-list.md)

- Create an intent that lists the todos stored in Firebase Database
- Change the project's Firebase Function to show the todo list from the Firebase Database 

## [Step 3: Complete Item](./03-complete-item.md)

- Create an intent that marks a todo as completed
- Change the project's Firebase Function to update the todo's status in Firebase Database

## [Step 4: Update Item](./04-update-item.md)

- Create an intent that updates the text of a todo
- Change the project's Firebase Function to store the updated text in Firebase Database

# Next steps
- Add functionality: completely delete an todo item from list
- Add functionality: complete all todos in list
